                   #Background Removal Tool
-This Python script removes the background from images and saves the resulting images in the specified directory.

                 #Installation
-To use this script, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

-rembg: A Python library for removing image backgrounds using an AI-based approach.
-Pillow: A Python imaging library for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats.
-You can install the dependencies using the following command:

                 #bash

-pip install rembg Pillow
-Usage
-Place the image file you want to process in the same directory as this script. Make sure the image file is in a supported format (e.g., JPEG, PNG).

Modify the input_path variable in the script to specify the filename of the input image.

     python
Copy code
input_path = 'sample.jpg'
Modify the output_path variable in the script to specify the filename for the output image. The output image will be saved in the same directory as the script.
python
Copy code
output_path = 'result.png'
Run the script using the following command:
bash
Copy code
python background_removal.py
The script will process the input image, remove the background, and save the resulting image with the specified filename.
Important Note
The script utilizes the rembg library, which relies on an AI model to remove the background. The accuracy of the background removal depends on the complexity of the image and the quality of the AI model.

It is recommended to test the script with different images and adjust the parameters or choose different models if the results are not satisfactory.

This script assumes that the input image and the output directory are in the same location as the script. If you want to process images from a different directory, provide the absolute or relative path to the input image.

Please ensure you have the necessary rights to use the images and comply with any licensing or copyright requirements.
